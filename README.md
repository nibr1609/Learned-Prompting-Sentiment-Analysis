# Sentiment Classification Project 🌟

## Project Description 📖

Sentiment Classification (SC) is the task of automatically analyzing text to determine its emotional tone, categorizing it as **positive** 😊, **negative** 😠, or **neutral** 😐. This classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem remains highly relevant today, powering applications like:

- 📊 Product review analysis
- 🗣️ Social media monitoring
- 💬 Customer feedback interpretation

In this project, you'll:

- Work with a dataset of **100,000+ labeled sentences** for training
- Build a model to predict sentiments for **12,000 unlabeled test sentences**
- Tackle this ternary classification challenge using modern NLP techniques
